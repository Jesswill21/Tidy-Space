FrontEnd Project
Code Louisville Jan 2019
This is my project for the frontend course of Code Louisville. 
My friend owns a cleaning company and does not have a website. 

Script.js is my Javascript that hides and fades in the title and also hides the form once the submit button on the form is selected. It sends an alert once the submit button is clicked thanking the visitor for their request.
