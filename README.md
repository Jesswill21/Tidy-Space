FrontEnd Project
Code Louisville Jan 2019
This is my project for the frontend course of Code Louisville. 
My friend owns a cleaning company and does not have a website. I used her business as my project.

Script.js is my Javascript that hides animates the title.
I used jquery to animate my slideshow between three pictures.
